# rock-paper-scissor
1. A Simple Rock Paper Scissor game:
Implementing a basic rock-paper-scissor game where the computer and player each get to choose their moves,here the computer chooses a random move, 
so the chance of winning of the player as well as the computer is equal.

2. So I've tried to increase the difficulty here.
The first round in this game is biased, so there's no chance the player wins this round :)
Here, the computer stores the player's previous move and tries to predict the next move based on the frequency of player's previous choices, then the computer chooses a counter attack based on it's guess.
